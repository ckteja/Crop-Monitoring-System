# Crop-Monitoring-System
This project aims to develop a crop monitoring system that utilizes modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) to help farmers improve crop yields, reduce water usage, and enhance the overall efficiency of their operations. The system is designed to collect and analyze data from various sources, including weather stations, soil moisture sensors, and drones, and provide farmers with real-time insights into the health and growth of their crops. The system also includes a user-friendly dashboard that enables farmers to visualize and track key metrics, such as soil moisture levels, temperature, and nutrient content. By leveraging this system, farmers can make more informed decisions about when to plant, irrigate, and harvest, leading to improved yields and reduced waste. Ultimately, this project has the potential to revolutionize the way we grow crops and address food security challenges.  

In this project, we aim to develop a crop monitoring system that can help farmers enhance the overall efficiency of their operations, reduce water usage, and increase yields, ultimately contributing to food security and sustainability.
